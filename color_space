color spaces are a way to represent color information present in an image.
3 popular color spaces are RGB, HSV and LAB.

RGB: red green and blue
both skimage and openCV read color images by default as RGB, but openCV stored color information as BGR!!!

HSV stores color image information as Hue, Saturation and Value,
it separates luma, or the image intensity, from chroma or the color information
it is used for applications where you need to change only pixel intensities and not color information
like, histogram equalization

LAB expresses color as 3 values: Lightness (consider this as your grey scale image),A (from green to red),
B (fromm blue to yellow)
it is used for application where you need to change only pixel intensities and not olor information,
like HSV, for histogram equalization

Either HSV or LAB can be used interchangeably for most image processing task.
